## Parallel Hello World

a) Write a simple parallel program that prints out something
(e.g. “Hello world!”) from multiple processes. Include the MPI headers
(C) or use the MPI module (Fortran) and call appropriate
initialization and finalization routines.

b) Modify the program so that each process prints out also its rank
and so that the process with rank 0 prints out the total number of MPI
processes as well.
