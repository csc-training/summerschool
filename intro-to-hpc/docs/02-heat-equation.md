# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic simulation

<div class=column>
* Particles are hard spheres
* They interact with neighbours inside some effective range
    - This way the particles appear “viscous”
* See live demo

# Group work assignment

* Within your table group, discuss the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) problem
* Make back-of-an-envelope sketches, etc, on how would you parallelize the selected problem
    - Which parts of the work can be carried out independently and in parallel?
    - What kind of coordination between the parallel threads will be needed?
* If you come up with several approaches, discuss their pros and cons

# Case study: heat equation {.section}

# Heat equation

<div class=column>

* Partial differential equation that describes the variation of temperature in a given region over time

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$$

* Temperature variation: $u(x, y, z, t)$
* Thermal diffusivity constant: $\alpha$

# Numerical solution


* Discretize: Finite difference Laplacian in two dimensions

 <small>
 $$\nabla^2 u \rightarrow \frac{u(i-1,j)-2u(i,j)+u(i+1,j)}{(\Delta x)^2}
  + \frac{u(i,j-1)-2u(i,j)+u(i,j+1)}{(\Delta y)^2} $$
</small>
Temperature field $u(i,j)$

# Time evolution


* Explicit time evolution with time step Δt

$$u^{m+1}(i,j) = u^m(i,j) + \Delta t \alpha \nabla^2 u^m(i,j)$$

* Note: algorithm is stable only when

$$\Delta t < \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \frac{(\Delta x \Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2
(\Delta y)^2}$$

* Given the initial condition ($u(t=0) = u^0$) one can follow the time evolution of the temperature field

# Solving heat equation in parallel

* Temperature at each grid point can be updated independently
* Domain decomposition

 ![](images/domain.svg){.center width=60%}

* Straightforward in shared memory computer

# Solving heat equation in parallel

* In distributed memory computers, each core can access only its own memory

* Information about neighbouring domains is stored in ”ghost layers”

 ![](images/ghost.svg){.center width=50%}

* Before each update cycle, CPU cores communicate boundary data: halo exchange
