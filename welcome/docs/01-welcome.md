- After the summer school, the participants will be able to:
  - Identify main parallel programming concepts
  - Create parallel MPI programs with C, C++, or Fortran programming languages
  - Create GPU-accelerated programs using HIP/CUDA
  - Recognize advanced parallel programming constructs
  - Understand and modify HPC applications utilizing MPI, OpenMP, and/or HIP/CUDA
