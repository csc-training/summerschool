## Hybrid Hello World

1. Write and run a hybrid MPI+OpenMP program that prints out MPI rank and OpenMP thread id on each thread.
2. Print out also the thread support level of the underlying MPI implementation and investigate its value.
3. Set `export OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true` and re-run the program. Are the thread and process affinities as expected?
