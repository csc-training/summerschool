# Why is this a problem for you ?

- Keeping track of all of your changes requires a lot of work
- Sharing code with colleagues and collaborating is slow and prone to errors

## You spend less time on things that actually matter!
Writing your code/scripts, running simulations and getting results

## Good science is reproducible!
What is the exact version/revision of your code used to produce some results?


# Solution: Version control

- A version control system (VCS) is a kind of a “time machine”

  - Keeps track of changes made to files

- And a project manager

  - Keeps track of multiple versions of the code

- Imagine it as something that sits inside your folder and helps you with
your files

# Advantages of using version control

- You can go back to the code as it was at any given point in time with
single command

- You can compare different versions of the code

- You can merge unrelated changes made by different people

- You can manually decide what to do with conflicting regions and some of
the work is done for you by the version control system

  - e.g. it does what it can and shows you the places where it needs manual intervention

# Version control with git {.section}

# Starting a git repository: git init

- We need to tell git to start "monitoring" our project folder
- Git won't do or save anything unless we tell it to
- creates a `.git` folder. Don't touch this!
    - contains all the info and data used by git, manual editing can/will break it
- **Terminology:** A git _repository_ = A project folder were git is operating



```bash
$ mkdir recipe
$ cd recipe
$ git init

```

# Choosing what we want to save: git add

- Selecting what changes we want to save
    - Moving and deleting files is also a change
    - Could be a folder, a couple of files, a single file or just part of a file

- You don't have to add all your changes at once!

- Does not change our files or save anything yet

```bash
.... editing some files
$ git add ingredients.txt

```




# Creating a snapshot: git commit
 - A commit is a saved state of your project
 - All changes that were added using `git add` are now part of the commit
 - A commit can (should) have an associated commit message
     - The message should be clear and concise: "Fixed bug #1234"
 - Git allows us to compare, merge, and checkout commits
     - Checkout a commit -> Set our project state to a specific commit

```bash
$ git commit

```

# Git file states: git status
 A file in a git repository can be in one of the following states

 - **Untracked**: Untracked files are ignored by git
 - **Unmodified**: The file is tracked by git, but no changes have been made
 - **Modified**: The file is tracked by git and has been modified
 - **Staged**:  The file has been added (`git add file1`) and is ready to be committed to your repository

`git status` shows the current state of your repository

# Project history: git log

- Each commit has a:
    - Message
    - Author
    - Unique id,  also called a commit hash
    - Submission date

- We use `git log` to inspect the history of our repository

# Whats the difference: git diff

 - Show the difference between two commits
 - Or the difference between a commit and the current state of your project
 - The commit hash is used to refer to a specific commit

# Remote repositories: Where things get really useful

 - You can have multiple copies of the same project in different places
     - A different folder, another computer, or a web-bases repository
    - You have a copy, your coworker has a copy, and so on...

 - This is what enables collaboration and sharing changes

 - You can also just copy a git repository and after that never interact with anyone

# Centralized vs. Distributed

- Git is a distributed version control system
     - I.e. every repository is self contained and _equally valid_

![](images/git_cent_dist.svg){.center width=50%}

# Remote repositories: Basic commands
  - `git clone`, to copy a repository
  - `git pull`, to retrieve changes from a remote repository
  - `git push`, to send our changes to a remote repository

# Remote repositories: Web services

- Git is usually paired up with a web-based repository
    - GitHub
    - Bitbucket
    - GitLab
- **These are not the same as git**, they are services built on top of git
- We will be using GitHub, exercises and materials at
<https://github.com/csc-training/summerschool>

# Social coding with git+GitHub

- Interact with collaborators
    - Scales from 1 to 1000+ contributors (may include your supervisor
      too\!)

- Open projects enable other people to join too

- Or have a direct influence on people who contribute by running a closed project

# Social coding with git+GitHub

- These days GitHub account also serves as your “code CV”

# Creating repositories on GitHub

<div class=column>
1. Create a new repository in GitHub
2. After this you can:
    - push a local repository to GitHub
    <small>
    ```bash
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/User/repo.git
    $ git push -u origin master
    ```
    </small>
    - clone the repository
    <small>
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/User/repo.git
    ```
    </small>


3. The local repository is now functioning and synced with GitHub

# Forking repositories

  - Copying a repository on GitHub to your own GitHub
    - So a GitHub feature, _not a part of git_
  - This is called “forking”
  - Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes
    without affecting the original project.
  - Once forked, we can again clone the repository to ourselves

![](images/fork.jpg){.center width=80%}

# Forking & cloning repositories

- Let’s fork & clone our first repository
    - Fork <https://github.com/csc-training/summerschool>
    - `git clone https://github.com/user/summerschool`

![](images/clone_fork.png){.center}

# Git workflow

1. New file changes are **pull**ed from the remote repository: `git pull`

    - Files are now up-to-date (in respect to the remote repository)

2. Something is modified
    - E.g. editing, adding or removing a file

3. Modifications are **add**ed for commit: `git add file.c`
    - Think of this as putting your file changes into a package

4. Changes are **commit**ted to the local repository: `git commit`

5. Commits are **push**ed to the remote repository: `git push`




# Git Workflow

- At every point, you can check the current status of the local repository
    - `git status`
    - What has changed? What is staged for a commit?

- Sometimes it is useful to drop local changes
    - `git stash`
    - Restores the local repository to the latest commit by stashing your changes (they can be retrieved later on)

- These are super useful, hence, use them often\!

# Branching

- By default everything is happening at “master” branch
- A branch is just a pointer to a commit
- You can freely create new branches

  - `git branch new_branch_name`
  - `git checkout new_branch_name`

- Extremely useful when you are working on multiple things/features
    - Allows you to keep a properly working version of a program, even though you are in the middle of major modifications.
    - Great for still unstable features

# Advanced features - Pull requests

- In bigger projects it is typical not to push directly but to send a
  “pull request” from your fork or branch
    - Typically done in the www-interface of GitHub
- Pull request is usually a fix or an improvement containing multiple
  commits
- Allows to review and modify changes

# Summary

  - If you are not using git, start using it\!
  - Remember the standard workflow:
      - pull -> modify -> add -> commit -> push
  - Explore GitHub, there are many cool repositories\!
  - Experiment with git and try out different features, its better to make
    mistakes now than later.


# Version control git commands

  - Download repository: `git clone https://…`
  - Update changes from remote repo: `git pull`
  - Check the status of repository: `git status`
  - Add new file for staging: `git add file1`
  - Commit changes to local repository: `git commit -m “X”`
  - Update local repo to remote repo: `git push`
  - Delete a file from repository: `git rm file1`
  - Documentation: `git help [cmd]`
