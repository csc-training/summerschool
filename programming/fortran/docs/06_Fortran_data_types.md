# Derived data types

# Built-in data types in Fortran

- Fortran has built-in data types for
    - integers (**`integer`**)
    - floating point numbers (**`real`**)
    - complex numbers (**`complex`**)
    - logical values (**`logical`**)
    - variable length character strings (**`character(:)`**)
- Each of these built-in types may be declared as multi-dimensional arrays

# Precision of built-in numeric types

- Fortran standard does not specify the precision of numeric types, i.e.
  how many bits are used for representing the number
    - Default is often 32 bits (real has then 7 significant digits)
- The numerical precision can be controlled through the kind parameter,
  e.g. 
```fortran
use iso_fortran_env, only : REAL64, INT16 
! ... 
real(kind=REAL64):: double_precision_number
integer(kind=INT16) :: short_integer_number
```

# What is a derived data type?

- Derived data type is a data structure composed of built-in data
  types and possibly other derived data types
    - Equivalent to structs in C programming language
- Derived type is defined in the variable declaration section of
  programming unit
    - Not visible to other programming units
    - Unless defined in a module and used via the use clause, which is
      most often the preferred way

# What is a derived data type?

- For real-world applications, using only intrinsic types is often
  insufficient
- It is beneficial to group the data together as larger objects
    - Code becomes easier to read and maintain
    - Cleaner interfaces
    - Encapsulation of data
- Variables used in the same context should be grouped together using
  modules and derived data types

# Derived type declaration

  - Type declaration 

``` fortran
type particletype
  real :: x 
  real :: y
  real :: z
  integer :: charge 
end type particletype
```
- Declaring a variable with a type 
``` fortran
type(particletype) :: proton, water(300)
```
- Elements are accessed with **`%`** operator 
``` fortran
write(*,*) proton % charge
```

# Derived type initialization

- Data type initialization 

``` fortran
water(1) = particletype(0.75, 0.19, 0.0, 1)
water(2) = particletype(0.0, -0.38, 0.0, 8) 
water(3) = particletype(-0.75, 0.19, 0.0, 1) 
! or elementwise
water(1) % x = 0.75 
water(1) % y = 0.19 
water(1) % z = 0.0
```

# Nested derived types

- Derived types can contain other derived types as components 
``` fortran
type moleculetype 
  type(particletype), allocatable :: atoms(:) 
  real :: mu
end type moleculetype 
!... 
type solvent 
  type(moleculetype), allocatable :: fluid(:)
  complex :: epsilon 
end type solvent
```
- Access as 
``` fortran
beverage % fluid(1) % atoms(1) % x = 0.75
```

# Data structures: memory layout

<div class="column">
**Array of Structures**

``` fortran
type point 
  real :: x, y, z
end type point

type(point), allocatable :: points

allocate(points(N))
```
</div>
<div class="column">
**Structure of Arrays**

``` fortran
type point 
  real, allocatable :: x(:) 
  real, allocatable :: y(:) 
  real, allocatable :: z(:)
end type point

type(point) :: points

allocate(points%x(N), & 
         points%y(N), & 
         points%z(N))
```

</div>

# Data structures: memory layout

<div class="column">
**Array of Structures**

``` fortran
integer :: i, j
real :: dist(4,4)
do i = 1, 4
  do j = i, 4 
    dist(i,j) = sqrt( & 
      (points(i)%x-points(j)%x)**2 + &
      (points(i)%y-points(j)%y)**2 + &
      (points(i)%z-points(j)%z)**2)
  end do
end do
```

# Summary

- Derived data types enables grouping of data to form logical objects
- A Fortran program becomes more readable and modular with sensible
  use of derived data types
- Handling of complex data structures such as linked lists or binary
  trees becomes more manageable with use of derived types
- Enables the use of object oriented programming concepts
