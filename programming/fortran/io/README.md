## File I/O

Implement a function that reads the values from a file bottle.dat. The
file contains a header line: “# nx ny”, followed by lines representing
the rows of the field. A skeleton code is provided in
[io.F90](io.F90). Once you have completed the implementation, you can
build the full program (io) with the provided [Makefile](Makefile). The
program writes out the data as png-image.
